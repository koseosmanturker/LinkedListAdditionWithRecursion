# LinkedListSumWithRecursion
Perform addition with a single-digit number and a linked list representing a number
<br/>
Given a single-digit number K and a singly linked list whose nodes stores digits of a non-negative number, add K to the linked list. 
For example, consider the linked list  “9 —> 9 —> 9 —> 4 —> NULL “ which represents the number 9993. Adding a single-digit number 6 to it should result in the linked list  “1 —> 0 —> 0 —> 0 —> 0 —> NULL” which corresponds to the number 10000.
Use recursion in your solution. <br/>

Output <br/>
Before addition: 9 -> 9 -> 4 -> NULL <br/>
Added value: 6 <br/>
Result: 1 -> 0 -> 0 -> 0 -> NULL <br/>
